      <p>Earlier today the Trajan administration introduced a bill to introduce taxes to Achora on March 8th. With future taxes announced to come in the future. Read to learn about them and prepare yourself.</p>

      <p>The bill, written by President Trajan and Economic Minister Ostoja, introduces both federal and provincial taxes, as well as a quarterly system to collect them. In this article, we will break down the taxes so they can be easily understood, so you can be prepared for them and remain informed.</p>

      <h3>First, Fiscal Quarters</h3>
      <p>The government has decreed that Achora’s “fiscal quarters” are to end on Wednesday and Saturday. All taxes, loans, fees, and other such things are to be paid on these days. The very first fiscal quarter will end on the 5th of this month, though as mentioned, taxes will not be payable until March 8th.</p>

      <h3>Second, Provincial Tax</h3>
      <p>Provincial taxes, which are required to be introduced by Provincial Regents starting on the 9th, will be 100 Achoran shekels payable every end of quarter. They will be required to be paid to live in a province. Only active users will face this tax.</p>

      <h3>Third, Federal Tax</h3>
      <p>Each Governor (Provincial Regent) will pay half of all collected tax revenue, from the aforementioned Provincial Tax, to the federal government. This is not a direct tax on the people and is only a concern for provincial governors. It is unclear whether or not this is due on all theoretical taxes or simply collected ones, and this remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the administration made clear that corporate taxes in one form or another were coming. So to any business owners out there: prepare your business to be taxed. We speculate this will likely be on sales.</p>p
      
      <p>All in all, prepare yourselves Achora. This Saturday is tax day, the first of a long line. Get your pockets ready to pay your governors. And of course, stay posted. As always, the <strong>AMN</strong> will continue to report on all laws and situations to keep you informed.</p>
