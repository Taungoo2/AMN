      <p class="date">Friday, February 28th, 2025</p>

      <p>This Friday the first debate in Achoran history was hosted by the <strong>AMN</strong> where the four presidential candidates—Trajan, Pipiop, Midget, and Amboush (Leaders of the The Achoran National Party, Freedom Party, Gruntist Party, and Red Dawn of Achora respectively)—faced off against each other. The debate included opening and closing statements, cross-sections, and questions centered around government leadership, economic policy, and legal statutes.</p>

      <p>The most prevalent issue at the debate, which was brought up repeatedly again and again, was the so-called “Ostojanomics.” Trajan and Pipiop sided with the economic policies of Economic Minister Ostoja, while Amboush and Midget stood vehemently opposed to them. This issue could lead to further cooperation between the former two and latter two, possibly deepening divides within their respective factions.</p>

      <p>The debate was held on a stage secured from Vas in South Lucilla by the <strong>AMN</strong>. Vas himself was one of the hosts of the debate, alongside Provincial Regent and Economic Minister Ostoja. The debate had a total attendance of roughly ten individuals, a great success for the <strong>AMN</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>AMN</strong> confidential polling revealed that of those present at the debate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3 believed Trajan had won the debate.</li>
        <li>2 believed Amboush had won the debate.</li>
        <li>1 believed Midget had won the debate.</li>
        <li>1 believed Pipiop had won the debate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Candidates were barred from voting for themselves.</p>

      <p>The divide on the central issue of the economy highlights the stark divide in Achoran politics as of now. As tensions rise, who knows where the election will lead.

      <p>And once again, we’d like to extend a special thanks to our corporate sponsors.</p>
